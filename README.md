# Sales Predictions based on Item MRP
## Through out this project I will be analyzing the correlation between items sold and item MRP.
**Cheyenne Quann**: 
### Business problem: How can we increase total item outlet sales for this company?
### Data: 
The data used to make my analysis is
 /content/drive/MyDrive/Coding Dojo/DataSets/sales_predictions.csv. This dataset contains all pertinent information about the undisclosed company's sales that will be used in my study.
  Methods:
- Data preparation steps with explanation and justification for choices
- I will familiarize myself with the data by going through it extensively 
- The data will be cleaned to allow for cleaner processing, readability and analysis
-I will check correlations and create visuals for presentation purposes
- I will implement machine learning models that would best be able to predict the future of undisclosed company's sales based off of the provided data 
-I will recommend the best model to use depending on the bias and variance present in my chosen regression models
## Results
#### Data Column Correlation

This is where I was able to decipher that Item MRP had the strongest correlation to the Item Sales.

## Model
I chose to implement a linear regression model
to make predictions based on the dataset with which I conducted my project. I believe that it yields the best with with minimal error based on its R2 metric.The Linear Regression model has a 57% percent R2 score and has been shown to present a good fit 
## Recommendations:
Based on my research the recommendation is to increase the Item MRP of the products being sold to increase the sale of these same products.
## Limitations & Next Steps
The limitations to this project were not knowing the specific company selling the products,the prices of said products demographics they serve and who their competition in the given areas are.
My next steps are to gather intel about surrounding companies in the same industry as well as the people that live in the neighborhood.
